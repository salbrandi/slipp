A package for updating a playlist with songs from your 'Song' list on Spotify
=============================================================================

``SLIPP `` (Song List In Public Playlist) slips songs from public to private lists automatically

``SLIPP`` uses the python package ``spotipy`` to fetch songs as they are added to
your private song-list and automatically add them to your public playlist, ensuring all your friends can
browse your wide array of well picked and tasteful tunes from your publicly made SLIPP playlist.

``SLIPP`` can also be run in update mode which compares the differences between your song list and the specified playlist
and resolve conflict in a specified way - either by pruning songs which have been removed or in add-only mode.
More documentation for this can be found in the 'examples' section



Installation
++++++++++++

``SLIPP`` can be installed with ``pip install slipp`` and will auto-install all dependencies.

``SLIPP`` is obviously dependent on having a spotify user account and the use of spotify. It only supports spotify.
